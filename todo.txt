TOO MANY CALLS TO REFRESH()!!!
check actor from execution plan -> on the server, check if the SocketClient is the current Actor and then set the actorID of the plan to that actorID

TODO:
    - 1. Spawn effect that show how much cash was generated.
    - 2. Add the dialogue UI... find a suitable target that knows a camera. Target cannnot be a server.
    - 3. Send/Receive events from server. The client is NOT allowed to execute events in MP
    - 4. ServerBroadcastEvent like CASH_UPDATE that gets applied once per turn.
    - 5. View must be ABOVE entity -> View hold sprite & entity.

Client clicks "START"
Server loads map async
Server tells clients to LOAD_MAP or LOAD_MAP_CUSTOM. Assume LOAD_MAP for now. Also SEND each actor the "client" for the map.
When CLIENT loaded -> send MP_CLIENT_MAP_LOADED to server.
When ALL CLIENTS loaded -> send MP_SERVER_START_MAP to clients
SERVER EXECUTES THE EVENT!!!
TurnManager is bugged to high hell.

MP_SERVER_SPAWN_ENTITY <- is an event.
onTurnStart causes heavy damage.
