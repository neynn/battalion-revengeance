Redo streamlined: Reduced production cost. Further from base is not possible because of stealth rules.

repairAction -> start repair and finish repair on the next active turn. onHit -> remove IS_REPAIRING flag.

TweenManager for effects.

air and submerged do not get hit by pierce
do check if entity.canSpawnThere before commiting
also check if the TEAM can produce the entity category

View should own the entity, not the other way around!

If an entities target is ON a landmine - trigger it anyway? Otherwise entities may stack on one tile.
What if it cant be triggered? Then entities WILL stack -> problem
If there already is an entity on the tile -> allow safe passage? Uncloak the landmine?

Uncloaking the landmine is a good idea because then i can just disable the pathing SAFELY without leaking information.
Landmine alpha?
