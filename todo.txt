Redo streamlined: Reduced production cost. Further from base is not possible because of stealth rules.

repairAction -> start repair and finish repair on the next active turn. onHit -> remove IS_REPAIRING flag.

Do NOT let the teamManager call stuff like onEntityDeath -> way too complex and too much indirection.
